# DFNN4GCC

## overview

* Experiment codes for paper, *Learning Deep Nets for Gravitational Dynamics with Disturbance through Physical Knowledge Distillation*
* A package implementing Deep Feedforward Neural Network for Gravity Compensation Control (DFNN4GCC) in Master Tool Manipulator (MTM) in daVinci Research Kit (dVRK).

## Requirement
* Ubuntu OS
* ROS
* python == 2.7
* Matlab (including robotics toolbox to run ROS API)

## Installation
1. Install [dVRK](https://github.com/jhu-cisst/cisst/wiki/Compiling-cisst-and-SAW-with-CMake#13-building-using-catkin-build-tools-for-ros).
2. Implement the [analytical solution](https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/dvrk-gravity-compensation) of GCC for dVRK (To obtain a Physical Teacher Model).
3. Install required Python packages
```bash
cd DFNN4GCC
pip install requirements.txt
```
4. Install DFNN4GCC
```
git clone https://github.com/linhongbin-ws/DFNN4GCC
```

## Run
1. open a terminal
  ```bash
  roscore
  ```
  open another terminal and launch the dVRK console to control the MTM.
  ```bash
  qlacloserelays
  rosrun dvrk_robot dvrk_console_json -j <path-to-your-MTM-json-file>
  ```
2. open Matlab. Go to the "DFNN4GCC" directory. Type in the command line
  ```
  rosinit
  addpath('<path to /dvrk-ros>')
  ```

3. modify `ARM_NAME`('MTML' or 'MTMR') and `SN`('Serial Number') in the file "run_collectData.m", for example:
  ```
  ARM_NAME = 'MTMR'
  SN = '41878'
  ```

4. run `run_collectData.m`

    In this program, we collect training, validating, testing data for a MTM. It take around **4** hours to finish the process. There are 4 subprocesses running in serial, `wizard program`, `generating pivot points`, `Collision Checking`, `data collection`, `data pre-processing`.

    * `wizard program` (required command inputs): A wizard program for setting the customized joint limits for specific dVRK system. This is important since it can identify the maximum joint ranges within a safety workspace. In anther words, it helps to improve the balance between safety and achieved performance. User need to type character to input some commands in the command dialog. There is a video to teaching user how to set joint limits using the Wizard Program [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8KM-scxTk4)].

    * `generating pivot points`: Generate the pivot points representing the desired positions of a MTM for training, validating and testing data.

    * `Collision Checking` (might require to press E-stop): Run through some pivot points to check if MTM will hit environment in the future data collection. Press E-stop if the MTM hit environment.

    * `data collection`: Collecting data. It should take around 4+ hours. If you pass the `Collision Checking`, you no longer need to worry about that the MTM will hit environment during this 4 hours. You can do others work waiting the program.

    * `data pre-processing`: Pre-processing the raw data to trigonometric representation.

5. copy the json file for the [analytical solution](https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/dvrk-gravity-compensation) to DFNN4GCC directory. For example:
In the terminal

    ```bash
    cp <path-to-json-file>/gc-MTMR-31519.json <path-to-DFNN4GCC>/data/MTMR_31519/real)
    ```

6. run `run_train.py`

    Modify `ARM_NAME`('MTML' or 'MTMR') and `SN`('Serial Number') in the file `run_train.py`, for example:
    ```python
    ARM_NAME = 'MTMR'
    SN = '41878'
    ```

    Run the program to train DFNN for Learn-from-Sratch(LfS) and Phyiscal-Knowledge-Distllation(PKD). Type in your terminal:
    ```bash
    chmod +x run_train.py
    python run_train.py
    ```



7. run `run_Controller.py`

     Run this script to run your GCC.
     * Modify `MTM_ARM`('MTML' or 'MTMR'), `SN` in the file `run_Controller.py`. For example:

    ```python
    MTM_ARM = 'MTML'
    SN = '41878'
    ```

  * uncomment the `controller_type` you want to use, for example

        ```python
        # controller_type = 'LfS' # Learn-from-Sratch approach
        controller_type = 'PKD' # Physical Knowledge Distillation
        # controller_type = 'PTM' # Physical Teacher Model
        ```

  *  In the terminal, Type

        ```bash
        chmod +x run_Controller.py
        python run_Controller.py
        ```

  Type `Ctrl+C` to stop safely.
